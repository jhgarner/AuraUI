Style parameters are just additional pieces of data attached to an element.
There are a handful of ways to specify them.

1. As properties on the element.
2. As defaults in a renderer
3. As overrides in a separate place

Developers are the only people that can change number 1. Developers have no
control over number 2 and only partial control over 3. Although overrides can
come from a developer (for example, to establish app wide font choices), the
user can always override them.

If a property is applied to something but not expected, it is simply ignored by
the renderer.

Properties include things like colors, fonts, image url, etc.

Properties can also be used to specify whether things should try to autohide or
if they should prefer wrapping over scrolling.
