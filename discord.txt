###
This document is WIP and a lot of the UI is still missing. I think it's far
enough along that I'll add it to the repo.

This is a pretty complicated one. You should check out the htop.txt example
first before diving in here.

I really leaned into the mentality of just trusting the renderer on this one.
If you look at the schema, it makes no reference to headers or sidebars.
Instead, it provides a lot of information and various heuristics do the rest. Of
course it's much easier to claim heuristics can solve all of these problems than
it is to actually create the heuristics.

One argument for why the renderer should have so much control is that there are
a ton of rendering targets. A header bar makes sense when viewing it in your
browser but doesn't make sense when viewed in a cli.


Schema:
###

Server = ServerC (*id Int) (name String) (icon String) (channels [Channel])

Server display as
  {Icon --path "$icon", fstring --string "$name", channels}

# Max width pulled from discord website
Channel = TextChannel (name String --maxWidth 32) (messages [UserMessage])
        | VoiceChannel (name String --maxWidth 32) (voices [Voices])

Channels display as
  TextChannel = {fstring --string "$name", Icon --path icon, messages}
  VoiceChannel = {fstring --string "$name", Icon --path icon, voices}

# Pros of this kind of design: It separates the data from the random icons and
# buttons that perform actions.
# Cons of this design: It splits the UI into multiple places which feels kind of
# weird but maybe it's not.
# I'm concerned that there might be a weird amount of overlap between interact
# and display block.
Channels interact as
  !{Icon -path "notif.png"} -help "Muting a channel..."

UserMessage = UserMessageC
              (icon String)
              # The max width is pulled from Discord docs
              (name String --maxWidth 32)
              (when Time)
              # TODO emoji should probably be defined elsewhere instead of
              # looking like a builtin.
              (myReactions CountSet -type emoji)
              (otherReactions Set -type emoji)
              (message Message)

UserMessage interact as
  # AppendLastPartial means the user can interact by appending to the end of the
  # list. Partial means that you can only edit the message field. When the user
  # expresses desire to append, the message field gets sent to the backend who
  # responds with the new element.
  !!message -appendLastPartial [message]
  !myReactions

# Search bars shouldn't be mentioned in the schema because they aren't data.
# That means searchable data needs to be marked somehow so that the renderer
# knows to contact the backend. The backend would then send back results and
# maybe specify parts of the results that matched the searched thing. I have no
# idea what searching over other types would look like...
UserMessage searchable as
  String

UserMessage display as
  {Icon --path icon -ratio "1:1", fstring --string "$name", Time --relative --time when,
  message, CountSet -union {myReactions, otherReactions}}

User = UserC
        (*id Int)

        (users [User])

User interact as
  !{fstring --string "block"}

User display as
  {fstring --string "$name", Image --path "$profile", fstring --string "$note",
   servers, users}


Message = TextM (*id Int) (text String)

        # What should be the type here?
        | AttachmentM (*id Int) (attach Attachment)
        # *Message means a point (using the id field)
        | ReplyM (*id Int) (text String) (to *Message)

# MyMessage is a valid Message, but Message isn't a valid MyMessage
MyMessage = Message

# Message supports modifying the contents of the message and the type of the
# message.
MyMessage Interact as
  # Sketchy pattern matching syntax
  !TextM = !text -withEmojis
  !ImageM = !image -from filePicker
  !AttachmentM = !attach -from filePicker
  # !to means that you can pick a message to reply to. Duplicating the list of
  # messages in the edit box is pointless so it will add an action to reply to
  # messages as you scroll past them. TODO How do we ensure you only reply to
  # messages in the current channel? Scala has path dependent types which might
  # be helpful here.
  !ReplyM = {!text -withEmojis, !to}
  # Lines without "=" apply to all messages
  !{Icon -path "trash.png" -help "delete message"} -hint {destructive, remove}

Voice = VoiceC (inChat [User]) (chatId Int)
Voice display as
  # Stream is a widget which handles streaming audio and/or video. A renderer
  # with a working stream widget should let the user continue a stream in the
  # background. I'm kind of worried thought because streams have a nontrivial
  # amount of UI in them that isn't directly controlled by the renderer.
  {inChat, Stream --id chatId}

Discord = DiscordC (discord [Server])

DiscordC [
  ServerC
    (name "Mines Movie Squad")
    (icon "mms.png")
    (channels [
      ChannelC
        (icon "hashtag.png")
        (name "General")
        (messages [
          UserMessageC
            (icon "jkrmnj.png")
            (name "jkrmnj")
            (when utc-time-stamp-here)
            (messages [
              TextM (text "Take a look at this!"),
              ImageM (image "userUpload-01234.png")
            ]),
          UserMessageC
            (icon "Zatton.png")
            (name "Zatton")
            (when utc-time-stamp-here)
            (messages [
              TextM (text "Wow, take a look at this docx file!"),
              Attachment (attach "userUpload-01234.docx")
            ])
        ])
    ]),
  ...
]

How?

UserMessage:
Since there are a static number of elements in UserMessage, we default to a
horizontal orientation for them. Since messages can be extremely long and all of
the elements need to be as tall as the tallest element, we'll put messages below
the other elements (aka make messages vertical). Things are almost good, but
it's no longer clear that the messages are related to the other elements. To fix
that, we'll make the icon 2 lines tall so that it's next to the username and the
first line of the message.

We can assume that only 1 line is for the time and the username in most
cases because the username is a max of 32 characters and the time is a locale
defined maximum width.

The UI above makes it sound like every single message has the name/avatar
duplicated all over the place. Although that's a valid way to render it, there
are other options. A renderer might detect multiple userMessages in a row with
similar information. Since the list can't be filtered or reordered, the renderer
is allowed to remove duplicate information to make the interface less cluttered.
If the avatar or username could be interacted with, then they wouldn't be
removable from the list.

???
You might be thinking "but wait, I can click on the avatar and username!".
Although you're right, that's not an interactive element. Instead, that is a
pointer to data about the user.
???

In the htop example, a list was interpreted to be a table. The discord ui isn't
interpreted as a table because it is not filterable or sortable. Since the
renderer won't be required to arbitrarily reorder elements in the list, it has a
lot of freedom about how to place them.

Side Bars:
Discord has two nested panels on the left. The first one contains a list of
servers and the second contains a list of rooms.

The renderer will detect that each channel contains a distracting element and
that the channels want as much space as possible. It can then decide to only
show one channel at a time. Now it needs a way to help the user switch between
channels. The renderer will try to find a subset of fields in the channel that
can help the user identify which one they want to click on. Since the leftmost
fields are the most identifiable, it will try to pick those for the subset
first. The name has a max size of 32 characters so it picks that as part of the
subset. It also grabs the icon to pull in because it fits.

The server list takes a similar chain of reasoning. In this case, the icons are
the most identifiable so they appear on their own. Since the name is strongly
identifiable too but might take up too much space, it appears on hover.


Header Bar:
The header bar is created by combining identifiable information with interactive
elements.

Add/Create server UI:
TODO
This offers some unique challenges. On the one hand, I'd like to use a similar
technique to the new messages ui. The problem though is that servers can be
created or searched and the ui around that is pretty flashy and complicated.

Settings (in various places):
TODO
I think this is a chance to really improve things. Discord has a lot of settings
buttons all over the place. Although it feels ad-hoc, I think it will integrate
well with the separate settings idea mentioned in the htop file.

Home:
TODO
The existing ui is kind of weird.

The voice settings at the bottom of every screen:
TODO
The mute and deafen buttons offer some interesting challenges. The user info
down there doesn't seem like it belongs. The user settings might belong
somewhere else.

User Profiles:
TODO
These might require adding new features to the schema.
