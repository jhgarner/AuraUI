Alignment:

Horizontal alignment means that elements take up space left to right. If they
would overflow the line, the take up additional vertical space. The ordering
of elements is top to bottom then left to right.

Vertical alignment means that elements take up vertical space first and never
sit 


Siblings:
If there are a known number of siblings, they are aligned left to right. If they
would take up more than a single line of space, they go top to bottom as well.
Elements must take up rectangular sizes.

KV pairs:
If there are a static number of KV pairs, each value asks for max vertical space
